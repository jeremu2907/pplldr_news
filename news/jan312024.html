        <h1>Podcast Kick-off:</h1>
        <h2>Leadership expert explains how employee feedback impacts the workplace</h2>
        <p>January 31st, 2023</p>
        
        <h3>About our Upcoming Podcast Series</h3>
        <p>
            The topic for our kick-off podcast is Giving Feedback (especially to your boss). We will have
            a guest expert of leadership who will share his experiences and his approach in using feedback as a tool.
        </p>

        <p>
            This topic was selected as the kick-off based on our prior survey, and holds a great deal of importance
            to all leaders - feedback enables people leaders to gauge the level of engagement of team members but
            also provides senior people leaders, such as your boss, the insight on how the strategic efforts are
            progressing and what steps to take in adjusting that strategy for it to be successful.
        </p>

        <p>
            For instance, a recent Gallup poll found that only 1 in 2 employees globally strongly agree that they
            know what is expected of them at work. This impacts an organization&apos;s productivity and is a
            reflection on the need for quality people leaders to always present an open door for feedback - if not,
            then nobody will talk with you in the future about anything.
        </p>

        <p>
            Join us for the remainder of February for several more podcasts on other topics such as what is strategy
            and why is strategy important for a quality people leader?
