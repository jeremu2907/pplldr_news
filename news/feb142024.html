        <h1>Giving Actionable Feedback:</h1>
        <h2>Developing effective leadership through actionable feedback: Building trust, engagement, and growth</h2>
        <p>February 14th, 2023</p>
        
        <h3>What is actionable feedback?</h3>
        <p>
            Actionable feedback allows people leaders to identify issues important to their teams and the organization
            - it's not complaining, but rather it allows an action with disposition of feedback in one of three ways:
            I heard you and changed something, I heard you but decided not to change something, or I heard you and would
            like to change something but can't at this time for these reasons.
        </p>

        <h3>You as a leader...</h3>
        <p>
            Actionable feedback requires that you develop a followership through loyalty, humility, skill sets,
            and honesty:
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Loyalty</strong></em> requires that teams and people leaders agree to the way ahead
            after dialog and will notbad-mouth or undermine the agreed upon plan - the team and people leader are a unified front.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Humility</strong></em> requires that people leaders realize that they do not know everything and
            need their people to provide actionable feedback - ignoring this opportunity will render them ineffective and
            soon without followers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Skill</strong></em> sets means that people leaders need to be the subject
            matter experts and know what they are talking about to build credibility and trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em><strong>Honesty</strong></em> - there is nothing worse than being surrounded by unauthentic people and bosses.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>
                Tell them what they need to hear as opposed to what they want to hear
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Actionable feedback demonstrates employee engagement
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                People leaders grow themselves and their people through actionable feedback - it builds trust as a cultural cornerstone
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                Be specific, don't use it to accuse others, and finally offer potential solutions when giving actionable feedback
            </p></li>
        </ul>
