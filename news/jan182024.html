        <h2>Things to keep in mind during your military to corporate move</h2>
        <p>January 18th, 2023</p>
        <p>Here is a list of some top recommendations from Veterans that were used during their military to corporate transition:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><a href="#one">
                Maintain a routine and discipline
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#two">
                Build your network prior to transition
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#three">
                Translate your military experience into easy terms
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#four">
                Leaders are life-long learners
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#five">
                Show that your mission is the People
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#six">
                Be the constant gardener
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#seven">
                Don't undervalue yourself
            </a></li>
            <li><a href="#eight">
                Take care of yourself
            </a></li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="one">Maintain a routine and discipline</h3>
        <p>
            This will assist with you staying positive and resilient as undoubtedly you will face rejection.
            Talking with other Veterans that successfully transitioned will keep you positive and engaged.
        </p>

        <h3 id="two">Build your network prior to transition</h3>
        <p>
            Talk with former military colleagues that already transitioned so that you can focus on what worked and what they
            recommend during your transition. Obtaining a mentor for this will be invaluable and assist you in things such as
            negotiating compensation and navigating the corporate culture once you receive and offer of employment.
        </p>

        <h3 id="three">Translate your military experience into easy terms</h3>
        <p>
            Use your network of successfully transitioned Veterans to aid in translating your military duty positions,
            descriptions, experience, education, and certifications into corporate speak. The majority of employers will
            not readily understand what is contained on a DD214, and you must therefore translate all for them through
            your resume - this will allow employers to match your skills with their postings.
        </p>

        <h3 id="four">Leaders are life-long learners</h3>
        <p>
            Read up on the industry or specific organization that you want to transition into for a career. This shows
            to potential employers that you are familiar with and have the potential to be a value-add to the company
            from the start, instead of being a cost to train with a learning curve.
        </p>

        <h3 id="five">Show that your mission is the People</h3>
        <p>
            Practice a 30-second elevator pitch about your leadership. Emphasize that the military approach is taking
            care of your people by teaching them the required technical skills; coaching to enhance those skills; and
            mentoring to develop and grow them into quality people leaders themselves. 
        </p>

        <h3 id="six">Be the constant gardener</h3>
        <p>
            This goes along with the prior mission and people recommendation. Employers need leaders that value their
            team members as individuals. They need leaders that have already proven themselves capable of developing
            and leading a high-performance culture within their organizations. The military has that culture, and
            Veterans were evaluated on their dedication to growing their people according to their strengths. Talk
            about this and reinforce it as your brand.
        </p>

        <h3 id="seven">Don't undervalue yourself</h3>
        <p>
            Your leadership experience and technical skill sets are in demand. If an organization selects another
            candidate for a position, then ask for feedback, but tactfully move-on to the next employer. Employers
            are in an unprecedented tight labor market and they are aggressively competing for acquiring and retaining
            high-performing talent such as you.
        </p>

        <h3 id="eight">Take care of yourself</h3>
        <p>
            Appreciate yourself and all that you have accomplished in the military - you are part of a very rare group
            of individuals that still believes in selfless service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reach-out to others. Talk through obstacles you encounter with your fellow Veterans. Seek out organizations
            that help Veterans in furthering educational goals such as

        </p>

        <h3>And lastly, but also importantly, breathe...</h3>
