        <h1>Revolutionizing How Top Talent Finds their Quality People Leader</h1>
        <p>Vol. I, Art. I</p>

        <h3>Strategic Partnerships</h3>
        <p>
            We are partnering with 
            <a href='https://www.militaryvetsofamerica.org/' target='_blank'>
                Military Veterans of America
            </a>
            in our commitment to helping America&apos;s
            Veterans during their transition from military to civilian careers. Capturing and documenting
            prior military direct reports&apos; / team members&apos; ratings of a Veteran&apos;s quality people leading skills
            and attributes offer a significant competitive edge over others when viewed by recruiters. PplLdr
            provides that opportunity for Veterans - you&apos;ve earned the respect as a leader, so why not showcase
            your quality people leading skills for others to view and find you as their next great leader?
            As we grow, we will continue seeking partnerships with multiple organizations that complement our
            service and further the importance of being a quality people leader.
        </p>

        <h3>How PplLdr Can Further Your Career</h3>
        <p>
            We strongly believe that quality people leaders are developed.  A quality people leader is one that
            provides a vision and target state for all of the teams to follow, builds relationships with their
            direct reports / team members, and aligns all through teaching, coaching, and mentoring their team
            in achieving that target state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Quality people leaders successfully influence their team toward achieving goals where they feel
            engaged and part of their organization&apos;s success: top talent of a quality people leader feel included,
            valued, supported, and empowered to succeed - they&apos;re not focused exclusively on financial metrics as
            a measurement of success.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bad managers account for nearly 70% of variance in employee engagement scores according to studies
            conducted by Gallup.  Unfortunately,
            <a href='https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx' target='_blank'>
                Gallup
            </a>
            also found that organizations fail to select the candidate
            with the right talent for leadership roles roughly 
            <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231593/why-great-managers-rare.aspx" target='_blank'>
                82% of the time!
            </a>
            Bad managers cost businesses billions
            of dollars that cannot be recovered and reinforce the maxim of people quitting their bosses, not their jobs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            PplLdr not only showcases who the quality people leaders are that have the right talent to lead an
            organization&apos;s people, but we provide content to further your growth and development.
